Question: In 3 sentences, compare and contrast the Cisco IOS-XE and Juniper JunOS network operating systems.
Answer: Cisco IOS-XE is a modular, scripted, and distributed network operating system that houses functionality in separate processes, offers advanced feature sets through packages, and aims to improve availability, resilience, and serviceability. Conversely, Juniper JunOS is a purpose-built, Unix-based network operating system known for its high stability, efficiency, and scalability, which uses a single modular OS for all Juniper devices to ensure consistency across platforms. While both have their strengths, Cisco IOS-XE supports broader hardware models with its modular design while Junos, by virtue of its standardized OS architecture, might offer better stability and simplicity in managing and troubleshooting diverse Juniper networks.
